        <h1>Hi! I&#x27;m Aaron.</h1>
      </a>
      <h2>I love to write code. Especially on the server-side, but I've been known to dabble in design.</h2>

      <h2>Let&#x27;s talk</h2>
      <h3>I&#x27;ve got skillz</h3>
      <p>I have been working with code for over a decade.  Started when I was 12 when I received the Visual Basic Bookshelf as a birthday present (you can spot the geeks early).  Since then I have always been into solving problems with code.  About 8 years ago I made the jump to the web, beginning with PHP and Perl, but about 4 years ago I started to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails.</p>
      <p>I cut my teeth as a PHP programmer for some 7 years now.  If you <a href="http://martinisoftware.com/resume.html">view my Resum&eacute;</a> you will see a few links to public contributions to projects.  These days you can find me writing Ruby and C code for a number of side projects such as <a href="http://github.com/martinisoft/listbotto/tree/master">Listbotto</a>.</p>
      <p>Ruby is my current language of choice, but I am been known to dabble in the client side with XHTML, CSS, and Javascript.  This website you are viewing is valid XHTML 1.0 transitional with CSS1 and 2 for the style.  If you look at the bottom of the page, I have a box that does jQuery based JSON calls to my github account (publicly available code) to show my current code projects.</p>
      <h3>I have already done some work internally</h3>
      <p>Last year our Lead Creative asked me to write a script to take the appointments for the day for scheduling in iCal.  This was before Concierge was updated to include scheduling.  I wrote a Ruby script nicknamed Maestro.  The script scraped the data from the page and used the Ruby AppScript bridge to talk directly to iCal to insert all the appointments for the day.  Before the concierge update, at least 8 stores that I know of and most of the southeast region was using this script to save at least 30 minutes a day in scheduling (I can provide references). This script no longer works due to the recent changes in Concierge, but I can provide the code upon request as a sample of my skills.</p>
      <h3>Consider me for the position</h3>
      <p>This would be a great opportunity to show Apple what I really do well (besides fixing Macs) in my spare time. I&#x27;m a very dedicated, meticulous, well-mannered guy (just ask my managers) looking for a bigger challenge than a broken iPod. Programming at Apple to me is that bigger challenge.</p>
