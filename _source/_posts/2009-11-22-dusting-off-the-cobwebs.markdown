title: Dusting off the cobwebs

Took many months, but I finally found some time to clean up and update my site design.  I owe a lot of the inspiration and code to Dan Cederholm's new book [Handcrafted CSS](http://handcraftedcss.com/). 

My strong suit is not web design and I have always struggled with keeping up on the latest innovations in that area.  Lately, I have made a conscious effort to follow leading designers and their published material.  The books that stuck and got me thinking differently were the books authored by [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/).  His style and explanations are simple to follow while comparing methods to a solution.  This works wonderfully for a logical guy like myself where I want to know what method works for certain situations.

The result is the updated design you see here.  I've littered my site with credits to [Dan](http://simplebits.com/) and [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/) to give props to these design gurus.  If you're wondering where I got the palette and design ideas, it was inspired by Dan Webb's new outfit [Massive Robot](http://massiverobot.co.uk/).  You could call me an imitator, but I'm happy to give credit where it is due.

Still more work to do, but this was a major milestone for me and giving me things to think about for next year.  I am moving to Tampa next month so the next entry may come after the new year when I am settled into my new apartment.
