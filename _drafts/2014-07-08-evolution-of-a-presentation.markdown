This post has been on my ideas list for some time now and I'm finally sitting down to write everything down. I'm often asked to articulate and explain my process behind creating and delivering a presentation. When I start down that path of explanation about 20 minutes later I realize this should probably get written down to help others in this process. What follows will be a case study of my "Hey, kid! Don't copy that floppy!" talk about software licensing and copyright.

## A scary idea

Coming up with the subject of a copyright talk has a funny and kind of scary back story. I remember being at Windy City Rails 2012 outside the main ballroom on the phone with my attorney. At the time I was about to give a talk called "Choose your own adventure" where the audience got to choose from 10 different lightning talks. One of them was the first version of my copyright talk. Why was I talking to my attorney? I wanted to make sure I would give accurate information and also avoid giving him more work from people taking me to court over bad advice. We quickly hammered out a legal pre-amble just in time for me to give the presentation.

The irony? The audience never selected that talk in the end. I was relieved, but I still wanted to present the information anyway and I would get my chance at Chicago Web Conf later that year. Since the talk was already in a lightning talk format, I got myself into the lightning talks section and nailed the timing of the presentation. Soon after giving the talk, a small group of 5 to 10 people approached me with questions, lots of them. Many of the questions people asked help guide the information for a longer format talk.

## Version one

After my lightning talk success, I decided it was time to see if this was a talk worth presenting. I finally came up with a talk title which comes from an old viral internet video about copyright. Once I had the title, I quickly made an abstract and submitted the talk to as many calls for proposal as I could find. The first one to come back? Ruby Fuza in South Africa. Yes, I freaked out a bit.

One of the first things I start when fleshing out a presentation is to create an outline of the talk. Think of it as the super rough first draft. I write down virtually every idea or bit of information I want to cover. This lets me get as many cards on the table, even if its duplicate or related information. Once it is all there, I'll start pairing down the information and eventually sections emerge. I'm not working on timing at this point, but more of the general flow of content.
