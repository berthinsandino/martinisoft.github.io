Earlier this year I wrote about my experience with burnout in technology and wanted to follow up with a post on how I've been coping and recovering. The title of this post is a euphemism for recovery from burnout. These will be my personal experiences so of course your own mileage will vary, but you may glean some ideas for your own situation from this post. Without further delay, let's cover a few of my ways to recharge.

### Furry Meetings & Conventions

One of my other public personas is a furry character called 'Martinisoft'. Despite what you may feel or have heard about furries, they are a fun bunch in general. In fact, one of the pivotal moments before I left my previous job hinged on me attending a furry convention. Getting that space from my job let me come back on Monday with a fresh and more objective perspective on my situation.

What I did not realize is embracing my furry side has unlocked a fairly deeply hidden creative self. I even chose a species that has personality characteristics that are normally not me in real life. My character is social and anyone who knows me can tell you I'm fairly shy around new people. Going to Furry conventions lets me explore being more social, being playful, and goofing around. I'm not thinking about job expectations and deadline pressures. It's an incredibly liberating experience that leaves me both exhausted, but renewed for work the week after.

### Ruby Conferences

Another of my favorite things to do is attend small (under 300 attendees) Ruby conventions. I am mentioning Ruby specifically because that programming community has a fairly different vibe than others I've experienced. People tend to favor hugs over handshakes, for example. Their community motto is MINASWAN. Now I will admit this philosophy is not followed by everyone as tech is still full of trolls, but Ruby conferences tend to collect the well meaning folks.

I recently attended my favorite event, Ruby DCamp. Personally I'm not an outdoors person and camping isn't exactly my cup of tea. Despite that, attending events like Ruby DCamp renew my faith in the programming world. People are helpful, they are hungry for learning, and exploration is fun. When I leave a Ruby Conference I generally feel both exhausted and hungry for more.
