### A Little About Me
I'm a passionate developer who's always looking for a challenge.  I have been programming since 1995 when I received an old copy of the Visual Basic 3.0 software developer kit as a birthday present.  Since then I've been taking apart computers and programs alike to learn their inner workings and make improvements.  This has usually been a hobby of mine, but I'd like to make it a serious career.  Simply put, I'm really good at troubleshooting and deconstructing problems, finding a solution and fully understanding the process as I re-create the steps.

### Fluent in many languages

#### Server Side:
Ruby, PHP, C, C++, Lua, Shell Scripting

#### Client Side:
JavaScript, CSS, HTML(All Specifications), XML

#### Frameworks:
Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, jQuery

#### Databases:
MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite

#### Tools:
git, svn, TextMate, premake, Cucumber, RSpec

### Server Sided

Developed a PHP based Jukebox system for Natural Selection radio when the other DJs were not broadcasting.  The system handled song requests and streamed them over Shoutcast.  This was later redesigned into a Ruby on Rails application and the broadcast system is being written in C++ to stream to a Shoutcast server.

Contributed to some open source PHP projects.  See [Text_Wiki](http://pear.php.net/package/Text_Wiki/download/0.15), [Highlighter](http://www.koders.com/php/fidD072C38D9FB382620240EC48AF2D55F71848A4CD.aspx?s=%22Aaron+Kalin%22#L6), [patTemplate](http://www.koders.com/php/fidC74F2B26AB1C9A178F6FC1EC45C557CC49064E1B.aspx?s=%22Aaron+Kalin%22#L45)

### Helpful To Others

In-game Support (GameMaster) and Quality Assurance for Neocron and [Neocron 2](http://www.neocron.com/), where I helped customers who had technical and account issues along with tracking and testing for bugs in the game. [I'm even listed in the game credits](http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,212419/).

Worked as a sales representative for Gamestop (formerly EBGames) where my knowledge of computers was useful to helping customers find the correct PC Game products.

A member of the [501st Legion](http://www.501stlegion.org/members/displaymemberdetails.php?userID=4802) since 2003, which is a non-profit Star Wars costuming group dedicated to charity and community service.

Currently in a customer service position with Apple, where I diagnose and troubleshoot problems for Mac, iPhone, iPod and iPad users. On the job I have managed an internal OSX Leopard and Snow Leopard server while also troubleshooting network, printer and workstation issues. I'm also an Apple Certified Macintosh Technician (ACMT) and have been since June 2008.
